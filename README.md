# test-tree-grid-db
TreeGrid demo adapted to use H2 database

This is a modification of the TreeGrid demo available on the Vaadin github site. This has been modified to store its data in an H2 database (stored on local disk).

Requires the `test-tree-grid-db-persist` project to create a database for this project to consume from.
